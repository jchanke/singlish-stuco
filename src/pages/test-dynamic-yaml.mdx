# Dynamic YAML Table Plugin Test

## Example 1: Original Particle Structure

```yaml
- particle: lah
  explanation: Used to strengthen statements
  examples: "Let's go lah!"

- particle: leh
  explanation: Expresses mild surprise
  examples: "Ok leh, that's good"
```

## Example 2: Different Structure - Study Methods

```yaml
- method: flashcards
  effectiveness: high
  time_required: 30 minutes
  difficulty: easy

- method: practice_tests
  effectiveness: very high
  time_required: 60 minutes
  difficulty: medium
```

## Example 3: Simple Two-Column Structure

```yaml
- term: syntax
  definition: The arrangement of words in a sentence

- term: semantics
  definition: The meaning of words and phrases

- term: pragmatics
  definition: The use of language in context
```

## Example 4: Should NOT Convert (inconsistent structure)

```yaml
- name: John
  age: 25

- name: Jane
  age: 30
  city: Singapore
```
