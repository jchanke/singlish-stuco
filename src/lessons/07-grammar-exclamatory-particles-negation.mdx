# Notes

## Exclamatory Particles

```yaml
- exclamations: aiyoh/aiyo
  explanation: |
    Usually inserted at the front of a sentence to express surprise, frustration, or mild distress. It has a similar meaning to "Oh no!"
  exercises: |
    "_Aiyoh_, I forgot to bring my wallet!"

- exclamations: alamak
  explanation: |
    This is a Malay phrase that expresses shock or dismay. It has a similar meaning to _aiyoh_.
  exercises: |
    "_Alamak_, I didn't know there was a test today!"

- exclamations: wah
  explanation: |
    An exclamation of amazement, awe, or maybe admiration. This is usually used to replace "wow!".

    Sometimes, it can also be used to add a little bit of sarcasm.
  exercises: |
    1. Amazement
    "_Wah!_ This new building is super nice!"

    2. Sarcasm
    "_Wah!_ You got girlfriend already can _hao lian_ ah?"

- exclamations: eh
  explanation: |
    Used to get someone's attention or show mild surprise. It functions like "hey!" or "huh?" in Standard English.
  exercises: |
    1. Getting someone's attention 
    E.g. "_Eh!_ Your chicken burning already!" 

    2. Mild surprise
    E.g. "_Eh?_ Where did my wallet go?"

- exclamations: jialat
  explanation: |
    A Hokkien-derived exclamation meaning "in big trouble" or "doomed". It is often used when a situation is severe or going very badly.
  exercises: |
    1. In big trouble
    "_JIALAT_, I lost my house keys and can't get in!"

- exclamations: sian
  explanation: |
    There are two ways to interpret _sian_. The first way is to express boredom, the other way is to express a feeling of being "fed up" about something.
  exercises: |
    1. Boredom: 
    "There's nothing to do today, I'm damn sian."

    2. Fed up
    "Sian! I've been waiting for this bus for 1 hour!"
```

## Sentence Negation

```yaml
- exclamations: no
  explanation: |
    Usually it can be used to start off a negation sentence, shortening the sentence structure.
  exercises: |
    A: "Why can't you sing properly today?"
    B: "No mood."

- exclamations: not
  explanation: |
    In Singlish, "not" can appear in short negative statement and questions. It can either be used to indicate something is not true.
    Sometimes, it is used as a tag-question at the end of a sentence.
  exercises: |
    1. Indicating that something is not true
    "Is not like that _lah_."

    2. Tag-question at the end of the sentence
    "You okay or not, _hah_?"

- exclamations: dun / don't
  explanation: |
    This is a very informal way of shortening an entire sentence. It can be used on its own or as a very short response to someone's idea or request. Usually it is shortened to have an implied meaning.
    For example: "Can dun?" means "Can you don't do that?"
  exercises: |
    A: "I'm going to burn this pizza."
    B: "Can don't?"

- exclamations: never
  explanation: |
    Standard English might use "didn't" or "haven't". In Singlish, you can substitute this with the word "never".
  exercises: |
    "I never see him today _leh_."

- exclamations: cannot
  explanation: |
    Usually used in a more direct, one-word manner. Used to replace "no".
  exercises: |
    A: "Let's do the project today?"
    B: "Cannot, no time."
```

# Class Activity

Get into groups of 3-4. We will think of three scenarios for you. Your job is to
form a response using both exclamations and negations in them.

For example: You forget to submit your assignment today.

Exclaim: "_Alamak!_ I forgot my assignment today again _sia_, cannot _lah_."
