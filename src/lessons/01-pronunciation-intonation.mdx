# Notes

## 1. Pronunciation

The intuition for this is to think "lazy", or expedience.

### Reduction / Omission of consonants in the suffix

1. **Plosives:** Reduction (or complete omission) of air expulsion.

| Consonant | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                                                | Examples                                                                   |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| p, b      | Both 'p' and 'b' are pronounced in a similar manner. The air pressure is reduced when compared to standard English. This is known as a "reduced" form. We use '∂' to represent this reduced pronunciation. | Reduction of the "p" plosive: - cap, Reduction of the "b" plosive: - crab  |
| t, d      | Both 't' and 'd' are pronounced in a similar manner. The air pressure is reduced when compared to standard English. This is known as a "reduced" form. We use '∂' to represent this reduced pronunciation. | Reduction of the "t" plosive: - hat, Reduction of the "d" plosive: - brad  |
| k, g      | 'k' and 'g' are both pronounced in a similar manner, which is a complete omission of air expulsion. We use 'ʔ' to represent this reduced pronunciation (glottal stop).                                     | Reduction of the "k" plosive: - bark, Reduction of the "g" plosive: - drag |

2. **Intuition:** Put your hand in front of your mouth to notice the difference
   in airflow in both the regular and reduced forms. As the name suggests, the
   reduced form restricts airflow and should result in a smaller gust of air
   felt. You can also place your hand on your diaphragm (near your tummy) and
   feel the smaller force exerted as a result of expelling this reduced volume
   of air.

3. **Fricative:** Denoting a type of consonant made by the friction of breath in
   a narrow opening, producing a turbulent air flow. Not all of the fricatives
   are mentioned here, but these are key ones to focus on.

| Fricative | Explanation                                                                                                                                              | Exercises                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| th        | "Th" is pronounced differently depending on the location. Here are some examples                                                                         | 1. "Th" as a prefix is pronounced like "T" E.g. "Tree" instead of "Three" 2. "Th" as a suffix sounds like an "F" This is known as th-fronting. E.g. "Boof" instead of "Booth" 3. "Th" in the middle of the word is pronounced like a "d" E.g. "Brudder" instead of "Brother" |
| v, f      | The intuition here is that the v and f are both pronounced in the same way. But in this case, they are being pronounced as a state of being "in between" | Reduction of v in the suffix: E.g. "Have" is pronounced like "Haf" Reduction of f in the suffix: "Stiv" instead of "Stiff"                                                                                                                                                   |

4. **Affricate:**

| Affricate | Explanation                                                                                                | Exercises                                                                             |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ch, j     | These sounds are often reduced by skipping the affricate's burst and transition directly to the fricative. | Reduction of "ch" affricate: - Match, Beach, Itchy Reduction of "j" affricate: - Huge |

### Reduction / Omission of other consonants

| Consonant | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Exercises                                                          |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| L         | "L" is a lateral approximate, meaning that air flows around the tongue when it is being produced. In Singlish, the "L" sound is often omitted, particularly at the end of a word or in unstressed syllables, to make speech faster and simpler. This "floating" terminal vowel sound also has the effect of sounding like an "r", which can be made audible in exaggerated forms of Singlish speech.                                    | 1. People → "Peope(r)" 2. Careful → "Carefoo" 3. Apple → "Appe(r)" |
| H         | The sound "h" in English is a voiceless glottal fricative. In Singlish, the "h" sound is sometimes omitted through lack of airflow, especially in unstressed positions or at the beginning of the word. However, do note that this is not always the case. Although some do, most Singaporeans don't actually omit the "h" (at least in my experience)                                                                                  | 1. Happy → "appy" 2. Hello → "Ello"                                |
| R         | The "r" sound in British (England) English is typically a post-alveolar approximant, produced by the tongue approaching but not touching the roof of the mouth. In American English and other British variants (Scottish, Irish), there exists rhotic sounds, or "ρ". In Singlish, the "r" sound typically follows neither and is often dropped especially in **non-initial positions**, giving rise to a more simplified articulation. | 1. Water → "Wateh" 2. Car → "Cah" 3. Flower → "Floweh"             |

### Reduction / Omission of vowels

- Consistent with unstressed vowels in certain words in British English
  - "Secretary" → Se-cre-tree
  - "Category" → Ca-te-gree
- Possibly gave rise to
  1. "Memory" → Mem-ree
  2. "Library" → Lib-ree

### Lack of vowel elongation

- "Teen" ↔ "Tin"
- "Sheep" ↔ "Ship"

## 2. Intonation

- Singlish speakers tend to use a flat intonation.

### Equal Emphasis and tone on every syllable

- Each and every syllable is given roughly the same amount of time and emphasis
- This contributes to the lack of pitch variation observed, and some common
  English mispronunciations

**Exercise:** "Where are you going?"

# Class Activity

Together, let's come up with a list of words that we haven't mentioned and write
it down. Then, we will go through how we can pronounce those words.

# Homework (on Canvas)

You will record yourself saying **2 words** for **each** of the five
characteristics **(at least 10 words in total)** of Singlish pronunciation
covered in class:

1. Reduction of plosives (p, b, t, d, g, k)
2. Reduction of fricatives (th, v, f)
3. Reduction of affricates (ch, j)
4. Omission of consonants (r, l, h)
5. Reduction/Omission of vowels

We encourage you to think of new words! It's also completely fine to reuse
examples taught in class from L1. We want you to get some practice and assess
how well you apply the concepts from L1; and you can retain the recordings for
future reference!

To help us with grading, please structure your audio recording in the following
way:

**"&lt;Category&gt; &lt;Word in Standard English&gt; &lt;Word in Singlish&gt;"**

Consider the following example:

_"For the reduction of plosives. Lip becomes lib, and dip becomes dib"_

While this homework assignment takes the form of a quiz, there is **no time
limit**. You might wish to use a voice recording application installed on your
computer (e.g., Audacity, Voice Memos for Mac).

Last, don't worry about doing it perfectly - we don't want you to spend too much
time re-recording just because you think you don't sound right. We don't expect
you to be flawless this early into the course and so, we are just **grading for
participation** :).
