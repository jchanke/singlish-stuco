# Notes

## 1. Some iconic Singlish moments

In the last 50 or so years, Singlish has evolved with the increased English
literacy of Singapore's population, running parallel to the waning proficiencies
in Chinese dialects and ever-rising influence from meme culture. We take a trip
down memory lane to revisit these moments, from the early days of Singaporean
television to the Internet.

You might find some of these clips familiar (we showed some of them during the
first-ever class). With your newfound Singlish abilities, as you watch, take
some time to appreciate how far you have come and notice the subtle ways
Singlish reflects a uniquely Singaporean identity, humour, and resilience across
generations.

## 2. Where is Singlish headed?

So, what does the future hold for Singlish? Like all languages, Singlish has and
will continue to evolve with time. From being
[shunned by Singaporean government 30 years ago](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/xF-83uoj-5g)
to now being a celebrated pillar of cultural identity, evolving social attitudes
about Singlish will also continue to shape the language.

Yet, a few things are certain. Singlish will remain a dynamic, evolving form of
expression. It will continue to reflect the era we inhabit while in some ways,
possibly offering a glimpse into the lived experiences of Singaporeans before.
With the digital upbringings of Gen Z and Gen Alpha, we will continue to see new
slang, emojis, and internet-speak blend into Singlish.

At the same time, the tension between formal English education and informal
Singlish use will probably diminish. To that end, it is possible that the lines
between Singlish (particularly the mesolectal form) and spoken Standard English
in Singapore might in some ways blur.

And so, we would like to thank you for being part of this trailblazing StuCo.
You, too, are now part of Singlish's ongoing story.
