# Notes

As mentioned in L1, Singlish is noted for its expedience. In this lesson, we
examine how its grammar permits an efficient conveyance of meaning compared to
Standard English (StE).

## 1. Elementary Rules of Singlish Grammar

We explore the defining characteristics of Singlish Grammar. They hinge on some
knowledge of word classes, which unsurprisingly, are identical to StE. This
makes it easier for comparisons between Singlish and StE to be drawn. However,
many deviations from StE arise from influences from languages such as Chinese
dialects, Malay, and Tamil. We also explore these differences in this section.

### 1.1 Nouns

**Plural forms:** In Singlish, nouns usually take the singular form regardless
of quantity. This is likely due to the influence of Chinese dialects, which also
do not differentiate between singular and plural forms.

### 1.2 Verbs

**"Got":** The most common verb in Singlish is "got", which is used to express
possession, experience, or existence. It can replace "have", "has", "had", and
"there is/are" in Standard English.

| Singlish                    | Standard English            |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| I got no money.             | I have no money             |
| She got a midterm tomorrow. | She has a midterm tomorrow. |
| You got time or not?        | Do you have time or not?    |

**"Got" for Past Tense:** "Got" is also used to express completed actions in the
past, similar to the present perfect tense in English.

| Standard English         | Singlish               |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| I did (do) the homework. | I got do the homework. |
| He had eaten his dinner. | He got eat his dinner. |
| She has seen the movie.  | She got see the movie. |

### 1.3 Tense Markers

Unlike StE, Singlish does not rely on morphological changes to the verb to
indicate tense. Instead, it uses temporal adverbs and markers to indicate when
an action takes place.

```yaml
headers:
  tense-type: Tense type
  standard-english-example: Standard English example
---
- tense-type: Past
  marker: |
    "last time"
  standard-english-example: I went to the market.
  singlish-examples: |
    I go (to the) market last time.
    **OR**
    I last time go (to the) market.
- tense-type: Past
  marker: |
    "already"
  standard-english-example: I already went to the market.
  singlish-examples: |
    I go (to the) market already.
    **OR**
    I already go (to the) market.
- tense-type: Recent past
  marker: |
    "just now"
  standard-english-example: I just went to the market.
  singlish-examples: |
    I go (to the) market just now.
    **OR**
    I just now go (to the) market.
- tense-type: Present and present cont.
  marker: |
    "now"
  standard-english-example: I am going to the market.
  singlish-examples: |
    I go(ing to the) market now.
    **OR**
    I now go(ing to the) market.
- tense-type: Future and future cont.
  marker: |
    "later"
  standard-english-example: I will (be) go(ing) to the market.
  singlish-examples: |
    I go(ing to the) market later.
    **OR**
    I later go(ing to the) market.
```

### 1.4 Particle Omission

**Articles:** Articles (both definite and indefinite) such as "the" and "a/an"
respectively can be readily omitted.

**Prepositions:** Specifically, "to" is omitted when in full infinitives
(to-infinitives). Full infinitives are instances where "to" is present in front
of a verb, such as in "to be", "to do", and "to see".

"to" is also omitted in instances as a preposition used to indicate location or
direction. These are usually instances where "to" follows a verb indicating
movement, such as in "going to".

**Linking verbs:** Linking verbs such as "is/are" are often omitted in Singlish.
This likely also arises from influences from the Chinese dialects and Malay,
which do not have dedicated linking verbs when used in conjunction with an
adjective. In Singlish, however, linking verbs can be omitted when used with
either nouns or adjectives. We see examples below:

| Singlish       | Standard English |
| -------------- | ---------------- |
| He (a) doctor. | He is a doctor.  |
| I hungry.      | I am hungry.     |

**⁉️ Wait then what about tenses???**

If the linking verb omitted contains crucial tense information, tense markers
are used (see Section 1.3).

## 2. Singlish Sentence Structure

Besides omitting various parts of speech, Singlish also adopts different
sentence structures. One such structure is **topic-prominence**, which is common
in many Asian languages, including Chinese dialects.

In topic-prominent languages, the topic of the sentence is placed at the
beginning, followed by a comment about that topic. This structure is different
from the subject-predicate structure common in English.

The general structure is: **Subject + Topic + Attribute**

Examples:

| Singlish                                                                           | Standard English                                     |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| This fella _(subject)_ job _(topic)_ very stable _(attribute)_.                    | This person's job is very stable.                    |
| This place _(subject)_ the safety _(topic)_ not good _(attribute)_.                | This place is not safe.                              |
| This movie _(subject)_ the main _(topic)_ character very attractive _(attribute)_. | The main character of this movie is very attractive. |
| This StuCo _(subject)_ the content _(topic)_ very interesting _(attribute)_.       | The content of this StuCo is very interesting.       |

**Relationships between nouns (possessive):**

| Singlish                                                       | Standard English               |
| -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| This person _(subject)_ car _(topic)_ very nice _(attribute)_. | This person's car is very nice |

**Relationships between nouns (of):**

| Singlish                                                                        | Standard English                                   |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| This neighborhood _(subject)_ the people _(topic)_ very friendly _(attribute)_. | The people of this neighborhood are very friendly. |

## 3. Flexibility with Singlish Grammar Rules

Rather than treating Singlish as a standardized language, it's better to
understand it as a continuum, or a quality of varying degrees that are built
upon StE grammar. Effectively, how much "Singlish-ness" you desire in your
speech is a function of many factors, something we will explore in detail in a
later class. But we want you to understand that everyday Singlish speech
incorporates one or a combination of the rules described above, but not
necessarily all.

And so, when applying the rules, don't see them as a checklist of items that
must be exhausted. The combination of rules you choose to use is down to your
personal discretion, often motivated by factors such as the degree of formality,
one's desired perceived social status, and the intended level of
specificity/ambiguity.

# Class Activity

### **Synthesis and Transformation**

Synthesis and Transformation is a key component of Singaporean elementary school
English examinations. It involves both multi-clause sentence construction and
active-passive voice transformations. In that spirit, we will be transforming
StE sentences to Singlish!

Some examples might permit topic-prominence! See if you can get those, in
addition to the naive transformations!

| Standard English                                                                | Singlish                                                                                                                                | Rules applied                       |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| I'm so hungry! I only ate an orange for breakfast.                              | I so hungry. I (for) breakfast only eat orange. _(Topic prominence)_ I so hungry. For breakfast I only eat orange. _(Topic prominence)_ | - particle omission, tense omission |
| He has been sleeping for most of the day.                                       | He _always/whole day_ sleep. _(Topic prominence)_                                                                                       | -                                   |
| CMU students are so overworked that they barely have any energy left to play!   | CMU students so overworked (until) no energy play. _(Topic prominence)_ CMU work so much got no energy play. _(Topic prominence)_       | - particle omission, singular form  |
| Have you heard? The Milkshake Factory will be offering half off Rusty's Shakes! | You got hear? Milkshake Factory offering half off Rusty's Shakes. You got hear Milkshake Factory half off?                              |                                     |
| I will be skipping class tomorrow because I have no time to complete the lab.   | I skip class tomorrow because no time complete lab. I tomorrow skip class because no time complete lab.                                 |                                     |
