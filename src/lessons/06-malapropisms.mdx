# Notes

## Forms of Singlish

Rather than treating Singlish as a standardized language, it's better to
understand it as a continuum, or a quality of varying degrees that are built
upon StE grammar. Effectively, how much "Singlish-ness" you desire in your
speech can be a function of many factors. Currently, we have abstracted the
forms of Singlish into two types:

### 1. Basilectal

This is the most colloquial form of Singlish and considered the most advanced
form for native English speakers. The cultural influences and borrowings from
Chinese, Malay, and Indian languages is most evident here in terms of syntax and
grammar.

It was once perceived as low status and generally spoken by Singaporeans who
were less educated and of a lower social class. This observation, noted by
renowned linguist John Platt in 1975, was especially true in Singapore's early
developing days where English literacy rates were still relatively low. Now, the
basilectal form is largely spoken by an older generation of Singaporeans who are
less fluent in English.

### 2. Mesolectal

Mesolectal Singlish is an intermediate form between
[S](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_English)tE and Basilectal Singlish.
Singlish attributes such as topic-prominence and grammatical particles are still
preserved, but the words used are largely English. This is also the form of
Singlish that we have been covering in class. Most young Singaporeans tend to
speak this form as well owing to their improved English proficiency.

While the acrolectal form (i.e., most correct, or _atas_), effectively becomes
Singapore StE, which for the purposes of this course we will not consider as
"Singlish". This, which differs from other StEs mainly by pronunciation, is
effectively grammatically correct English as an StE form.

## English malapropisms in Singlish

### 1. What is a malapropism?

According to Uncle ChatGPT,

A **malapropism** is the mistaken use of a word in place of a similar-sounding
one, often with unintentionally humorous or nonsensical results. It usually
happens when someone misuses a word that sounds like the intended word but has a
completely different meaning.

Here are some examples:

| Incorrect                                    | Correct                                      |
| -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Texas has a lot of _electrical_ votes.       | Texas has a lot of _electoral_ votes.        |
| She's the _pineapple_ of politeness.         | She's the _pinnacle_ of politeness.          |
| He's a very _ambiguously_ talented musician. | He's a very _ambitiously_ talented musician. |

The term **"malapropism"** comes from the character **Mrs. Malaprop** in Richard
Brinsley Sheridan's 1775 play _The Rivals_. She was known for frequently
misusing words in an unintentionally comical way.

### 2. Examples of Singlish malapropisms

Some English literature majors might disagree with how I have chosen to
categorize these words as malapropisms (which would be terribly ironic given the
topic of this lecture!).

| Malapropism in Singlish | Standard English                  |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| laterwards              | afterwards                        |
| ownself                 | oneself                           |
| irregardless            | regardless                        |
| loose                   | lose                              |
| off day                 | day off                           |
| shag                    | shackly (derived from ramshackle) |

## Misused English words in Singlish

  singlish: Misused word in Singlish
---
- singlish: gantry
  standard-english: turnstile/egate/arm barrier gate (for motor vehicles)
  explanation: |
    Complicated! It all began with the Electronic Road Pricing (ERP) gantries rolled out in 1998, which were actual gantries! These gantries used RFID to wirelessly deduct cash from a prepaid card tagged to their vehicle.
    Then, all was fine until 2004, when the government rolled out the Electronic Parking System (EPS), which were basically arm barrier gates that charged motorists exiting parking lots. It was likened to the ERP in many ways (after all, the technology was basically identical), and so Singaporeans began erroneously calling these barrier gates "gantries".
    Then (yes, there's more!), Singaporeans, presumably through fallacious association with the EPS, assumed that gantries were mechanized access-control structures where one had to pay for admission/exit. So, they started calling subway turnstiles (where consumers would tap transport cards) … you guessed it - gantries!
    And soon, "gantry" was being used to refer to any electronic turnstile and egates in general. In fact, it has been officially embraced as Standard Singapore English (used by the government in official press releases too!)
- singlish: chop
  standard-english: stamp
  explanation: |
    The word ‘chop' was originally from the Malay word cap, which is from the Hindi word छाप ćhāp (stamp).
- singlish: borrow (me)
  standard-english: lend (me)
  explanation: |
    Direct translation from Chinese as the words for "borrow" and "lend" are the same.
- singlish: Christians/Catholics
  standard-english: "-"
  explanation: |
    Most Singaporeans don't realize that Catholicism is a branch of Christianity; "Christian" is often synonymous with "Protestant".
- singlish: rubber
  standard-english: eraser
  explanation: |
    This is somewhat contrived because it hails from British slang.
- singlish: follow
  standard-english: accompany
  explanation: |
    Direct translation from Chinese as "follow" and "accompany" can be implied by the same word.
- singlish: keep (an item)
  standard-english: tidy (up a place)
  explanation: |
    Direct translation from Chinese as "keep" and "tidy" can be implied by the same word.
- singlish: marketing
  standard-english: grocery shopping
  explanation: "-"
- singlish: mug (for an exam)
  standard-english: cram (for an exam)
  explanation: |
    Derived from archaic British slang "to mug up (for an exam)"
- singlish: open (the light)
  standard-english: turn on (the light)
  explanation: |
    Derived from Chinese as "open" and "turn on" are translated from the same word.
- singlish: pass up/hand up (an assignment)
  standard-english: hand in
  explanation: "-"
- singlish: send (one home)
  standard-english: drive (one home)
  explanation: |
    Derived from Chinese as "send" and "drive" are translated from the same word.
- singlish: take/taken (a meal)
  standard-english: have/had (a meal)
  explanation: |
    Confusion in possessive implications of both "take" and "have".
- singlish: 1-for-1
  standard-english: 2-for-1
  explanation: |
    Unknown; could be attributed to "buy 1 get 1 (for) free"
