## What is Singlish?

A portmanteau of the words "Singapore" and "English", Singlish is an informal,
colloquial form of English spoken in Singapore. This is _not_ the same as
Standard Singapore English, which is a form of English in Singapore employed in
more formal and academic settings, widely accepted as the correct form.

More specifically, it is an English-based _creole language_, which is a
syncretized natural language formed from the contact of two or more constituent
languages. (Don't worry, this is as linguistically technical as we'll get in
this class!)

1. **History**

   - Singapore was a British colony from 1819-1963\*
     - British established Singapore as a British trading post
   - Rich cultural milieu
     - As a trading post, it attracted immigrants from Southern China and South
       India
     - Folk indigenous to the region (Malay Archipelago) known as the Malays\*
   - Poor accessibility of English education until independence (1965)
     - Most Singaporeans spoke native tongues that corresponded to their ethnic
       identity
       - Chinese dialects (Hokkien, Teochew, and Cantonese) for Southern Chinese
         people
       - Malay _(Bahasa Melayu)_ for the indigenous Malay people\*
       - Tamil for South Indians and Ceylonese Tamils
     - English education was mainly reserved for a small elite of Singaporean
       society, besides its existing use in government affairs
     - Independence created an impetus for English education, which was seen as
       vital for economic development
   - People lived "double lives" linguistically
     - English at school in the day
     - Their native tongues back home at night

2. **Attributes**

- Influenced by the native tongues of the three main ethnic groups
  - Tonal (from Chinese dialects)
    - e.g., pitch rise on the word "think"
  - Grammatical syntax (from all three languages)
    - e.g., Omission of articles in speech ("the", "a", "an")
  - Syllable-timed and, to a certain extent, isolating in meaning (from Chinese
    dialects)
    - Equal time allocated for each syllable (all effectively stressed)
    - Staccato quality when pronouncing multi-syllable words
  - Loan words (from all three languages), e.g.,
    - _kaypoh_ from Hokkien, to mean a "busybody";
    - _agak-agak_ from Malay, to mean "estimate"; and
    - _dai_ from Tamil, to mean "hey"
- Influenced by British English
  - Slang
    - "rubbish bin" instead of "trash can"
    - "lift" instead of "elevator"
  - Pronunciation
    - Taller and longer vowels
    - Non-rhotic "r" sounds
- Influenced by Indian English
  - Slang
    - "give you one tight slap" to mean to slap someone
    - "bungalow" to mean a large colonial-era style house

3. **Cultural Significance**
   - Key pillar of a shared identity for a young nation of just over 6 million
     people
   - Constantly evolving, more than just a historical relic
   - Constant reminder of how most of its inhabitants, much like the U.S., are
     of immigrant stock

# üôã Class Activity

Today, we will watch a three minute snippet of "Phua Chu Kang". Phua Chu Kang is
a Singaporean sitcom spoken primarily in Singlish (It is important to note that
not all Singaporean films or TV shows do this).

**Context**: Phua Chu Kang _Pte Ltd._ is a construction company (he is often
referred to as a contractor). In this snippet, we will see how Phua Chu Kang
interacts with his wife and family.

**Your Task**: Although it may be difficult right now, try to understand as much
as you can from this short snippet. We want you to present and share one
sentence that you understood, and one sentence that you did not understand. We
will then do some sharing and learning in class.

- Join the class [Piazza](https://piazza.com/class/m5u51780i8o543) if you
  haven't already! Reach out to us if you have not been added yet.
- Do some research about Singlish, post one item or area we did not cover in
  today's class on Piazza. It could be anything from a new word to a unique
  parallel you observed with another language.
