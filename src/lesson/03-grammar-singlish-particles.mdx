# 🗒️ Notes

## Introduction

**What is a particle of speech?**

A particle of speech refers to a word that doesn't neatly fit into any
traditional parts of speech (like nouns, verbs, adjectives) and instead
functions to modify or add meaning to another word, often appearing as a phrasal
verb.

In other words, particles add contextual information to a sentence. For example
"up" in "look up" or "to" in "to run".

In our lesson, we will use the words "ok" and "really" to add particles behind.

**What are Singlish particles?**

Singlish uses about 11 particles, mostly borrowed from Hokkien or Cantonese, to
indicate attitude to what was being said to you. They work rather like "you
know" or "you see".

### Particles in Singlish

**Assertive**

Assertive particles express speakers' positive commitment to what they are
saying.

```yaml
- particle: lah
  explanation: >
    Commonly used to strengthen or finalize a statement. There are two
    intentions behind using "lah" behind a sentence:

    1. Adding adamance

       A: "Can you faster cook?"

       B: "Ok lah! Stop rushing me."

    2. Reducing bluntness and sometimes even a bit of doubt.

       A: "How was your day?"

       B: "Ok lah. Didn't really do much."

  examples: |
    1. Adding adamance:

       "Let's go now lah!"

    2. Reducing bluntness:

       "I'm tired lah, can we take a break?"

- particle: leh
  explanation: >
    Used to express mild surprise or gentle agreement with someone.
  examples: |
    1. Mild surprise
       A: "How was your exam? "
       B: "Ok leh. Easier than I thought."
    2. Gently agreeing
       A: "Do you think my idea is ok? "
       B: "Ok leh. Let's go for it."

- particle: lor
  explanation: >
    Indicates resignation or acceptance. It conveys an "oh well" or "that's how
    it is" tone.
  examples: |
    A: "Let's just get this done and over with"
    B: "Ok lor. Whatever you say."

- particle: meh
  explanation: >
    Used to question or express skepticism about a statement. Often shows
    disbelief or a challenging tone: "Really? Are you sure?"
  examples: |
    A: "I got 100 on the midterm!"
    B: "Really meh? You were struggling on the practice the night before."

- particle: sia
  explanation: >
    An exclamation to convey strong emotion—excitement, admiration, annoyance,
    etc. More informal and often used by younger speakers.
  examples: |
    1) Excitement and admiration
       A: "How did you find the concert?"
       B: "Not bad sia! I would watch it again"
    2) Annoyance
       A: "Have you met Jason?"
       B: "He flaked on me again sia! I'm so angry"
```

**Contradictory**

Contradictory particles are used in utterances which explicitly contradict
something a prior speaker has said.

```yaml
- particle: mah
  explanation: >
    Used to politely but firmly correct or contradict someone. It can emphasize
    that something is obvious or a matter of fact.
  examples: |
    A: "Wah, the homework is so hard."
    B: "Ok mah. Was it hard?"

- particle: what
  explanation: >
    Typically used at the end of a statement to challenge or deny a previous
    point. It strengthens your disagreement or contradiction. Often sounds
    casual but direct.
  examples: |
    A: "Do you think Jun Wei is a good guy? I really dislike him."
    B: "Ok what. He's quite a daddy leh."

- particle: one
  explanation: >
    Usually used to imply that something is in fact the case, or that it must be
    done in a certain way. For example, "cannot like that one" means "That's not
    acceptable."
  examples: |
    A: "Are you sure we can do this without the teacher's permission?"
    B: "Ok one. I've done it many times before."
```

**Tentative**

Similar to assertive particles, but adds a bit of an apprehensive tone and
offers less commitment and assertion.

```yaml
- particle: hor
  explanation: >
    Used to check for agreement or gently prompt a response, somewhat like
    "right?" or "isn't it?" It softens the tone, making the speaker sound less
    pushy and more open to the listener's feedback.
  examples: |
    A: "You ok hor?"
    B: "Ok lah, just feeling a bit sick"

- particle: ah
  explanation: >
    **ah** is one of the most flexible particles in Singlish. It can be used as
    a casual question marker, to soften the tone of a statement, or simply as a
    filler. The exact meaning often depends on intonation.
  examples: |
    A: "You sure it can work ah?"
    A: "Orh, that's how it works ah~"
    A: "You see ah, that's what happens when you don't listen to me"

- particle: eh
  explanation: >
    Similar to "hey" in English. Often used to get someone's attention ("Eh,
    listen!") or to convey mild surprise ("Eh, really ah?").
  examples: |
    A: "Eh! Why you stealing my food?"
    A: "Eh! Hello, didn't expect you here"
    A: "Eh? Where did my food go?"
```
