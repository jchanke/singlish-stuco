# 🗒️ Notes

Now that you have some conception of Singlish grammar and the backbone of
sentence structure, it's time to sound even more Singaporean with some Singlish
vocabulary! Lesson time will be used to go over most of these words and to
address questions on correct use.

Detailed explanations for some words have been omitted as we want you to try
your hand at looking up some of these terms on the recommended resources (such
as Chimbridge). You can even try your hand at deducing some of their
etymologies.
